# Cryptography-Class
This is where all my crypt stuff goes, it's pretty fresh not gonna lie

Arithmetic Ciphers: each of these have relativly small keyspaces so I made them into "brute force" programs that run all possible keys at once for an inputted string
1. Caesar Cipher - takes the values of each latin character as an array indexed 0 and adds a certain key (modulo 26)
2. Multiplicative Cipher - takes value and multiplies with number relativly prime to 26
3. Affine Cipher - Multiplicative Cipher followed by a Caesar shift, two encryptions in one

Word-Based Ciphers: these also run brute force

4. Codeward Cipher - create a new alphabet using a codeword special letter and using the positions in that alphabet to form encrypted way of writing
5. Vigenere - uses a codeword and a 26x26 matrix called a "tabula recta" to form an encrypted form of writing

Matrix Ciphers: these require keys in the form of matrices

2x2 Hill Cipher - uses a 2x2 matrix made with integers modulo 26 to multiply the value of digraphs made from a string of latin characters, the program will add null characters like "x" or "q" if the inputted string is not divisible by 2
3x3 Hill Cipher - same as 2x2 but with Trigraphs and divisiblity by 3 needed by strings
Playfair - a 5x5 Matrix made from 25 latin characters, use special rules made from digrpahs from the inputted string, divisibility by 2

//NOTE: KLING KRACKER IS CURRENTLY UNOPERABLE IN THE AFFINE CIPHER AND WILL NOT BE UNTIL I CAN PRIORITIZE IT ON A LATER DATE, IT WILL BE //UPADTED TO INCLUDE A VARIETY OF CIPHERS LATER ON, INCLUDING MY FINAL PROJECT

Update: The Neely Enigma Machine has been uploaded and contains a GUI with all the 8 private key ciphers learned this trimester in Cryptography
